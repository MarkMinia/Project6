# Titanic Machine Learning: Human vs. Iceberg


##### As part of the machine learning course, we all attempted one of the competitions posted on Kaggle, which was "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster." By using what we have learned in the course material and supplemental resources online, we attempted to create a model that could predict who survived the event based on some key passenger information.
