# Titanic Machine Learning: Human vs. Iceberg

#### [Google Collab Submission](https://github.com/MarkMinia/Project6/blob/main/KAGGLE_TITANIC.ipynb)

##### As part of the machine learning course, we all attempted one of the competitions posted on Kaggle, which was "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster." By using what we have learned in the course material and supplemental resources online to guide us, we went thorugh the step-by-step process in creating a model that could predict who survived the event based on some key passenger information. The goal was to achieve the highest accuracy possible.
